# Master-Thesis
In this repository, it is possible to find all the files related to the Master Thesis.\\
These files are named in the report, so when reading it, it is possible to know where they belong in. All the files are commented, so it is easier to follow them.
On the other hand, in this repository, there are .pkl files corresponding to the dataset and the labels to train the Neural Networks that has been programmed in this project. The dataset and the labels for the sNN and the LSTM are the same, since these two models were programmed in such a way that they require the same input. When it comes to the CNN, it has got its own dataset and labels, since it requires a different input shape.
The folder containing the sNN and LSTM models (lateral and frontal) with their corresponding dataset is the one called "sNN and LSTM.zip". Regarding the CNN one, its folder is called "CNN.zip".
